# Lab 04-HTML-Templating

**Author**: Ahmed Ali & Melanie Cohen
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
<!-- We are building a blog app so that users can filter articles by both category and author via dropdown. Today we built in Handlebars.js functionality and changed functions to arrow functions. -->

## Getting Started
<!--The user must first fork this repository. Once the repo is forked, the user must clone their new repo onto their machine. From there, the user can open the site using the index.html or using live-server. -->

## Architecture
<!-- We used Javascript, HTML & CSS, using Normalize to reset the browser settings and Iconomoon for icons. We also used Handlebar.js for HTML templating. The CSS files are sectioned into three sections: base, layout, modules, and state. The JS files include blogArticles.js (with the raw data), article.js (which instantiates objects and pushes them to the DOM), and blogArticles (which filters data according to category or author), using the Handlebars framework. -->

## Change Log
<!-- 01-12-2018 12:00pm - Application successfully uses Handlebars.js and arrow functions.

## Credits and Collaborations
<!-- Normalize CSS reset, Iconomoon, and Handlebars.js -->
