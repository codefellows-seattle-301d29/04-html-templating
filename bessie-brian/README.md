# HTML Templating

**Author**: Brian Bixby & Bessie Arino
**Version**: 1.0.8

## Overview
This is a blog app. It allows us to read articles published by numerous authors.

## Getting Started
First  fork the source repo and create the dir and branches needed. 
Then set up the DOM tree, bringing in the files needed to build the app. 
Then we started going through the TODOs in the .js files.

## Architecture
We are using javascript, html, .css and jquery to build this app.

## Change Log

01-12-2018 10:03am - Application now has functional Handlebars.js template to fill in the articles. And functions have been refactored using lexical arrow functions.

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.
