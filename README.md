 +
 +## Overview
 +<!-- I am building a blog application.  This app takes information from the data file and renders it on our main blog/article page, and we've created filters to allow us to get specific articles and information from the app. -->
 +
 +## Getting Started
 +<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running?
 +The user should start with creating an html scaffold. Then create a .js data file that houses all the information for each specific blog post. Create another .js file that takes the information from the datafile and does stuff with it. Then an .js file that affects how the articles are viewed on the blog application page. create css files and style. -->
 +
 +## Architecture
 +<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information.
 +We are using html, css, javascript, and a jQuery library to design the application.  We utilized SMACCS styling guides for categorizing our information -->
 +
