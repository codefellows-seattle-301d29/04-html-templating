# Kilovolt Blog

**Author**: David and Tama
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This is a blog. The goal is to create a blog that is mobile first, but built to scale using responsive web design techniques, supplying the viewer with a clean, navigable, legible interface, built to comp.

## Getting Started
Download the source code, install node.js and npm and the npm package live-server, then run npm from within the source code directory. The site will be served at port 8080 on that machine.

## Architecture
HTML for structure and content, CSS for styling, JavaScript for functionality, jQuery for a layer of abstraction on top of JS. Designed using a Mobile First, RWD philosophy with SMACCS and MVC thinking directing the organization of the files.

## Change Log
12 Jan 18 12:00pm - Initial PR made.

## Credits and Collaborations
Credit to the actual writers of the code - Tama and I added a few features. Stack overflow was - as usual - quite helpful, as was the Handlebars documentation.
